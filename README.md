# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python.

## Introduction

This project is a basic implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python. It's a console-based game where two players take turns to make their moves on a 3x3 grid.

## Features

- Player vs Player gameplay.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Checks for valid moves and prevents players from overwriting existing moves.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` file to start the game.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves.

## Usage

- Use the numeric keys to specify the row and column for your move.
- The game will display the current state of the board after each move.
- The first player to complete a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol wins the game.

## Installation
